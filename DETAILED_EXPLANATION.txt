ML Pipeline:
1. Image upload
2. MTCNN face detection
3. FaceNet embedding extraction
4. Database comparison using cosine similarity
5. Threshold-based match determination

**1.4 Database Implementation**
The system uses MongoDB for storing user data, face embeddings, images metadata, sketches, and assets.

1. MongoDB 6.0+ for document storage
2. PyMongo 4.6.0 for database operations
3. Connection pooling for efficiency
4. Base64 encoding of face embeddings
5. Cursor-based queries for memory efficiency

Database Collections:
- users: User accounts
- faces: Face records with embeddings
- sketches: Composite sketch records
- assets: Sketch component assets
- otps: Email verification codes
